#### ⛸ Scriptlets - even more control!

Did you know that scriptlets are powerful filters too? While browser-based ad-blocker extensions provide some level of ad-blocking, scriptlets take it to the next level! Scriptlets are small snippets of code used in ad-blockers, specifically designed to block ads on websites. By targeting specific elements on a webpage, such as images or text associated with advertisements, scriptlets prevent those elements from loading or being displayed. They offer enhanced control over filters by directly accessing the page you're viewing.

Scriptlets are considered an advanced feature and are supported by only a select few ad-blockers, especially system-wide ad-blockers that work both inside and outside browsers. [AdGuard](https://adguard.com), one of the most popular system-wide ad-blockers, is known for its excellent scriptlet support.
