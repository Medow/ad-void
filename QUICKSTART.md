#### ü§î What is ad-blocking?

Ad-blocking is a technique that has become increasingly popular over the years as users try to maintain control over their online experiences. While there are many ways to block ads on the web, one of the most effective and widely-used methods is to use a browser extension or add-on.

#### üïµüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How does ad-blocking inside browsers work?

Ad-blocking inside browsers is a technique that uses browser extensions or add-ons to block ads from appearing on web pages. These extensions work by intercepting requests for ads and preventing them from loading. When you visit a website that has ads, the ad-blocking extension checks the site's code and identifies any ad-related requests, it then blocks those requests, preventing the ad from being displayed on the page - if possible - or hides any visible ads. All of this is possible by using `filters`.

<br>

#### üëΩ Filters for what?

Ad-block extensions use filter lists to block unwanted ads on websites. Filter lists are essentially sets of rules that define what should be blocked and what should be allowed. These lists are constantly updated and maintained by filter list authors who work to keep the lists up-to-date with the latest ad-blocking rules.

#### ‚ú® Benefits of ad-blocking

One of the primary benefits of using an ad-blocking extension is that it can significantly improve your browsing experience. Ads can slow down page load times, and they can be distracting or even obnoxious. By blocking ads, you can enjoy a faster, cleaner browsing experience with fewer distractions.
<br>
Another benefit of ad-blocking inside browsers is that it can help protect your privacy. Some ads are designed to track your online activity and collect data about your browsing habits. By blocking these ads, you can prevent companies from collecting this information.

#### üíª Installing an ad-blocker

When in your browser - like you are right now, click on any of the links for extensions above and locate the `Install` button, click on it and grant permissions for install.

<br>

After that, head to [AdVoid](https://github.com/igorskyflyer/ad-void/blob/main/README.md) and look for the `Subscribe` buttons on the page because now you need to subscribe = install filter lists.

<br>

`AdVoid.Core` is as a must, the rest are optional but very much recommended to install (except the experimental filter) if you need them! Read the description of each filter list and what it blocks and install it only if needed.

<br>
<br>

#### üíé Why AdVoid exactly?

AdVoid blocks ads, trackers, malwares, fake download links and a lot more if you want it to! Things like: cookie-consent banners, popups, modals, push notifications, survey, newsletter and subscribe popups, rating dialogs, sharing, Google Chromecast, popup chats, post widgets, like widgets, comments, service workers, news widgets, JavaScript and CSS maps, PWA install banners, Webmanifests, SWF objects.

<br>
<br>

#### üò¢ Shortcomings

However, it is worth noting that ad-blocking is not always perfect. Some websites may detect that you are using an ad-blocking extension and refuse to display their content until you turn it off. Additionally, some ad-blocking extensions may interfere with certain website features or even break the site entirely.

#### ‚õ∏ Scriptlets - even more control!

Sometimes using filters with a browser-based ad-blocker extension isn't enough! That's where scriptlets come into play! Scriptlets are small pieces of code used in ad-blocker extensions that are designed to block ads from appearing on websites. These scriptlets typically work by identifying specific elements on a webpage, such as images or text, that are associated with advertisements, and then preventing those elements from loading or displaying. They provide much more control over filters since they can access the page directly.

Scriptlets are an advanced topic and are supported in only a few ad-blockers, most notably in system-wide ad-blockers; ad-blockers that work outside browsers as well. [AdGuard](https://adguard.com) being one of the most used system-wide ad-blockers.
