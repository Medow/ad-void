#### â›¸ Scriptlets - even more control!

Sometimes using filters with a browser-based ad-blocker extension isn't enough! That's where scriptlets come into play! Scriptlets are small pieces of code used in ad-blockers that are designed to block ads from appearing on websites. These scriptlets typically work by identifying specific elements on a webpage, such as images or text, that are associated with advertisements, and then preventing those elements from loading or displaying. They provide much more control over filters since they can access the page you're viewing directly.

Scriptlets are an advanced topic and are supported in only a few ad-blockers, most notably in system-wide ad-blockers; ad-blockers that work outside browsers as well. [AdGuard](https://adguard.com) being one of the most used system-wide ad-blocker that supports them.

You can find the scriptlets in this directory.
